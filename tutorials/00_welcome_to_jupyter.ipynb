    "- <kbd>Y</kbd>: Convert cell to Code\n",
    "- <kbd>D</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>: Delete cell\n",
    "- <kbd>O</kbd>: Toggle between hidding or showing an output\n",
    "- <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>/<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: Select several cells\n",

In this case, you will either have to wait for control to be returned to the Python interpreter or, in more severe circumstances, forcibly terminate the Python process in your operating system (using the task manager in Windows or the kill command in Linux, for example)."
